# Real-Time-Face-Emotion-Detection
In this project, we developed a real-time face emotion detection system using Python and deep learning techniques. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), our system accurately detected and classified facial emotions in real-time. Through an extensive literature review, we explored existing methodologies and collected a diverse dataset of labeled facial images, which we preprocessed and used to train our model. Integrated into a real-time application with Python and OpenCV, our system successfully processed live video frames, predicting emotions in real-time. Evaluation results showed promising accuracy, although challenges like low lighting and occlusions should be addressed. Overall, this project contributes to the field of real-time face emotion detection, demonstrating the potential of deep learning for accurately understanding and responding to human emotions in various applications.
